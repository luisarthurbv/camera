    Projeto com muitos Jabutis:
        https://www.camara.leg.br/proposicoesWeb/fichadetramitacao?idProposicao=2270789

Main goal:
- Have a centralized place to know about politics (The MVP is about the Camara dos Deputados)

What we will have first:
- First we will get all the data from https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/ to know a bit who the deputados are.
- Also fetch the data from the original website from camara https://www.camara.leg.br/
- Model all this data
- Have an interface on Whats App to ask Questions

In the future:
- Fetch all the proposicoes and see what they are about using LLMs
- Fetch all the licitações and know what they are about
- Link this information to Deputados and Partidos

In the far future:
- Fetch the everyday data from politician's social network profiles


Architecture now:
- Monolith Nest Application web server - Domain and some interface
- Python scripts to extract data - it will be a data pipeline in the future - This should be the core of our application
